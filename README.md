## Introduction

This repository caricatures all of the research that I have done to date, starting at Cornell University in Fall 2016. I principally do research in the subfield of [programming languages](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/lang) within computer science, but some of the work that I like often crosses over into the [architectural side](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/architecture) of things.

As of right now, the repository contains:
- An LLVM "hacking" session, as it were, wherein I explore how to bypass the LLVM front-end and create my own compiler passes based on a [tutorial](http://adriansampson.net/blog/llvm.html) that my research advisor wrote for graduate students.

## Background

I work closely with [Prof. Adrian Sampson](http://adriansampson.net) at Cornell, and some of the topics that I explore include the following:

- Approximate computing and the hardware-software interface
- ISA generation and heterogeneous chipsets
- Developing better GPU frameworks for heterogeneity in optimized programming
