# research

## Introduction

This repository caricatures all of the research that I have done to date, starting at Cornell University in Fall 2016. I principally do research in the subfield of [programming languages](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/lang) within computer science, but some of the work that I like often crosses over into the [architectural side](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/architecture) of things.

As of right now, the repository contains:
- An LLVM "hacking" session, as it were, wherein I explore how to bypass the LLVM front-end and create my own compiler passes based on a [tutorial](http://adriansampson.net/blog/llvm.html) that my research advisor wrote for graduate students.

## Background

I work closely with [Prof. Adrian Sampson](http://adriansampson.net) at Cornell, and some of the topics that I explore include the following:

- Approximate computing and the hardware-software interface
- ISA generation and heterogeneous chipsets
- Developing better GPU frameworks for heterogeneity in optimized programming

## (Auto-)Biography

Here is a little blurb about me:

I was born in Flushing, NY in late November 1996, which makes me 19 years old at the time of this writing. Quite young, eh? Flushing is a lively neighborhood in the borough of Queens in New York City, with about a [70% Asian and Asian-American population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens#Demographics) as of the 2010 census. If that doesn't speak to "the bubble effect", I don't know what does.

  I moved to Princeton, NJ (a much less gentrified area, with lots of open space and preserved land) in mid-November 2007, and went to junior high school and high school near there, graduating in 2014 with top honors in mathematics and the sciences. I accepted an offer from Cornell University's engineering school in early 2014, and matriculated in the fall of the same year. I've been here since!
  
  I study computer science at Cornell, though I have dabbled with electrical engineering, economics, mathematics, physics, and music theory before (both in and out of school). I mostly got destroyed by those classes, though, so I have since learned to stick with computer science.
  
  In my final year at Cornell, I decided to pursue research after two \[meh\] internships in the fintech industry that showed me that the corporate world is not one to which I belong. Academia seems to be a better fit for me thus far, so I'm trying my hand at research. I've always liked both programming languages and systems, so working with Adrian has been a great opportunity, in my opinion!
  
  I will be graduating from Cornell one year early in May 2017, and hopefully I will be able to attend a graduate school thereafter so I can keep on doing research in PL. I would love to continue doing research here at Cornell (because of the environment -- though the weather could be better). `#stressculture`
  
  In my free time, I run and play badminton. I also watch the NBA regular season and playoffs every year (I've been a big Cavaliers fan since 2008!). Any other spare time I have usually goes around to either tinkering around on my computer or practicing piano, which I've been playing since April 2005.
